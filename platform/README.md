## What This Is

This directory contains the operational infrastructure I built and run for a **production analytics platform** serving multiple industry verticals with industry-specific KPIs. Every file here runs in production on GCP.

This isn't a tutorial or a toy project. This is how I operate real systems.

## Platform at a Glance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Industry Engines** | Multiple verticals (Finance, Crypto, Energy, Gaming, Sports, Weather, Compliance, and more) |
| **KPIs Computed** | Industry-specific KPIs across all verticals |
| **ETL Pipelines** | Fully orchestrated with lineage tracking |
| **Automated Tests** | 750+ (security, integration, data quality, contracts, RBAC) |
| **API Endpoints** | 60+ across 7 blueprint groups |
| **Uptime SLO** | 99.5% availability, p95 < 500ms |
| **Infrastructure** | GCP e2-medium, Ubuntu 24.04, 6 systemd services |

## Engineering Highlights

### CI/CD Pipeline (5-Job CI + Automated CD)

The CI pipeline runs **5 parallel jobs**: ruff linting, pytest with coverage against PostgreSQL 16, bandit + pip-audit security scanning, CycloneDX SBOM generation, and build validation. The CD pipeline deploys to GCP via SSH, runs the full test suite on the VM, and auto-rolls-back on failure.

```

  +-> Lint (ruff) ----+
  +-> Test (523) -----+-> Build Validation -> CD Deploy -> Smoke Test
  +-> Security -------+
  +-> SBOM -----------+
```

### SLO Monitoring with Error Budgets

The health monitor tracks 3 SLIs in a rolling 10,000-request window:

| SLI | Target | Tracking |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Availability | >= 99.5% | % of non-5xx responses |
| p95 Latency | < 500ms | Response time percentiles |
| Error Rate | < 1% | 5xx response percentage |

Error budgets are calculated per SLO with burn-rate alerting (ok/warning/critical). Job queue metrics track processing throughput with p95 latency.

### RBAC + Immutable Audit Trail

4-role hierarchy with wildcard permission matching (`jobs:*`, `*:read`). Every RBAC denial, auth event, API mutation, and job state transition is written to an append-only PostgreSQL table protected by database triggers that prevent UPDATE and DELETE.

### Infrastructure as Code

Full Terraform configuration for the GCP stack: compute instance with startup provisioning, 6 firewall rules (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, app, deny-RDP, internal-only PostgreSQL), and 3 GCS buckets with versioning and lifecycle policies.

### Operational Maturity

- **Deploy**: Pull, install, test, restart, smoke test — auto-rollback on test failure
- **Rollback**: Creates backup tag, restores target, re-tests, reverts if tests fail
- **Backup**: Daily PostgreSQL dump + config archive, GCS upload, 30-day local retention
- **Monitoring**: 5-minute cron checks disk, memory, services, SSL expiry, database health
- **Alerting**: 4 severity levels, email for WARNING+, JSONL audit log, alert history API

## How I Operate This Platform

This isn't a "deploy and forget" system. I actively operate it:

- **523 automated tests** gate every deployment (security, integration, data quality, contracts)
- **SLO dashboard** tracks availability, latency, and error budgets in real-time
- **Immutable audit trail** logs every auth event, API mutation, and job transition
- **Automated backups** run daily with GCS upload and 30-day retention
- **Dependency scanning** via Dependabot (pip + GitHub Actions, weekly)
- **SBOM generation** on every CI run (CycloneDX format)
- **Performance baselines** documented with alerting thresholds
