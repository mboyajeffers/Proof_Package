### The Challenge

FastLane, a licensed sports betting operator with customers across the US, UK, Canada, and Europe, needed a comprehensive analytics solution addressing both environmental sustainability and social responsibility metrics. Regulatory requirements demanded:

- Environmental impact reporting for ESG compliance

- Multi-jurisdictional compliance reporting

---

### The Solution

- Tracked 7 market types (ML, Spread, Total, Prop, Parlay, Futures)
- Analyzed 3 channels (Mobile, Web, Retail)

**Dual-Focus Analytics**
