## About Me

I'm a Data Engineer with full-stack pipeline ownership—from raw data ingestion through KPI computation to automated report delivery. I built **CMS Enterprise**, a production analytics platform processing data across 11 industries with 188+ KPIs, multi-currency support, and real-time market data integration.

This repository contains **proof of capability**: real analytics outputs I've generated across multiple industries, demonstrating enterprise-grade data engineering and analytics engineering practices.

### What I Bring

| Capability | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| **Large-Scale Processing** | 23.6M rows (Netflix), 7.7M rows (Disney) processed with production pipelines |
| **Multi-Industry Expertise** | Finance, Betting, Sports, Compliance, Solar, Weather, Media |
| **End-to-End Ownership** | Ingestion → Validation → Transformation → KPIs → Executive Reports |
| **Production Systems** | 11 analytics engines, 188+ KPIs, 30+ currencies in production |
